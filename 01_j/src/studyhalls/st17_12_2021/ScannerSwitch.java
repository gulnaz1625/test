-Area of a rectangle is length*breadth. Enter length and breadth of a rectangle and print its area.
-Area of a square is its side*side (or side*side). Enter the side of a square through user and print its area.
-Area of a circle is π*r^2 (π*r*r)<==>(3.14*r*r). Where π=3.14 and r is the radius of the circle.
Enter the radius of a circle through user and print its area.
