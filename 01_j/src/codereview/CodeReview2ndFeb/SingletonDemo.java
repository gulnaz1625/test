/*
Using Singleton pattern we ensure that a class only has one single instance.
This is achieved by making:
- a private constructor; so that the class cannot be instantiated outside its code
- one single private static instance of that class; its private so that it cannot be changed or dereference outside its class
- a public getter method of the above instance
